**Interested in contributing a code example?** 

Please take a look at our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before
getting started. Thanks!

<!-- Before submitting your code, please delete the above code contribution
instructions and this comment as they will not be relevant in your code 
example README.md.-->

# <demo_name>

Describe your example and specify what it is demonstrating. Consider the
following questions:

* Is it pedagogical or a usable application?
* Does it belong to a particular domain such as material simulation or logistics? 
* What level of Ocean proficiency does it target (beginner, advanced, pro)? 

A clear description allows us to properly categorize your example.

Images are encouraged. If your example produces a visualization, consider
displaying it here.

## Usage

A simple command that runs your program. For example,

```bash
python <demo_name>.py
```

### Inputs
If your example requires user input, make sure to specify the input format and any input limitations.
### Outputs
An example program output.

## Problem Description 

Objectives to be optimized: the goals the process attempts to accomplish by minimizing or maximizing certain aspects of the problem to the extent possible; for example, a production-line optimization might attempt to minimize the time to produce all of the products.

Constraints: aspects of the problem and/or process, with limited or no flexibility, that must be satisfied for solutions to be considered feasible; for example, a production-line optimization might have a limitation that Machine A can only bend 10 parts per hour.

## Model Overview
The clearer your model is presented here, the more useful it will be to others. For a strong example of this section, see [here](https://github.com/dwave-examples/3d-bin-packing#model-overview).

### Parameters
List and define the parameters used in your model.

### Variables
### Expressions
### Objective
Matching the objective description in the previous section with the mathematical formulation of the expression based on the problem paramaters and variables
### Constrains
Matching the constraint description(s) in the previous section with the mathematical formulation of the expression based on the problem paramaters and variables

## Code Overview

A general overview of how the code works.

We prefer descriptions in bite-sized bullet points:

* Here's an example bullet point

## Code Specifics

Notable parts of the code implementation.

This is the place to:

* Highlight a part of the code implementation
* Talk about unusual or potentially difficult parts of the code
* Explain a code decision
* Explain how parameters were tuned

Note: there is no need to repeat everything that is already well-documented in
the code.
